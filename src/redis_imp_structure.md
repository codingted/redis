 * is one directly managed by a Redis module. In this case the value points
 * to a moduleValue struct, which contains the object value (which is only
 * handled by the module itself) and the RedisModuleType struct which lists
 * function pointers in order to serialize, deserialize, AOF-rewrite and
 * free the object.
 *
 * Inside the RDB file, module types are encoded as OBJ_MODULE followed
 * by a 64 bit module type ID, which has a 54 bits module-specific signature
 * in order to dispatch the loading to the right module, plus a 10 bits
 * encoding version. */
